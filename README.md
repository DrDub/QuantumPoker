# Quantum Poker
This repository contains all the necessary components to learn and play quantum poker. This game is based on Texas hold 'em poker with the main difference being that the community cards are replaced by qubits and the player cards are replaced by quantum logic gates.
This implementation is a proof-of-concept.

## How to get started
The game requires the Qiskit package for Python to be able to run. For help installing Qiskit please see [qiskit.org](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html). In the Jupyter Notebok file [runPokerJN.ipynb](runPokerJN.ipynb) an example game along with instructions on how to play the game is included. To play the game, either open the file [runInteractivePokerJN.ipynb](runInteractivePokerJN.ipynb) through Jupyter Notebook (in a Qiskit environment) or run the file [runPoker.py](runPoker.py) locally. Running the game in Jupyter Notebook is notably slower than running the proper Python file.

We hope you enjoy playing the game.
